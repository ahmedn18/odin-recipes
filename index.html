          The crispy batter, crunchy cookie, and creamy filling combine to make
          one of the world's most decadent fair foods. "This is a carnival
          favorite where I grew up," says Olivia C. "Oreos get dipped into
          pancake batter and friedâ€”yummy! You can do this with or without a deep
          fryer."

          Big juicy burgers filled with chilies, cheese and mushrooms, then
          grilled and basted with steak sauce. Use any type of cheese you like.

          asks for all the time!
