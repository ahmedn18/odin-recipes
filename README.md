This is a project done by me (Ahmed Nader) to demonstrate my knowledge and ability in writing HTML code (which is not really "code" but anyways). It's a recipe website which shows some delicious recipes! Funny enough. 

The project contains:
1. Main Page containing links for the recipes.
2. Each recipe page contains an image of the meal, description of the meal, the ingredients needed, and a full meal preparation guide.
