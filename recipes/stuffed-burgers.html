    <h2 >Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (10 fluid ounce) bottle steak sauce, divided (e.g., A-1)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fajita seasoning</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dried minced onion</li>
      <li>8 slices American cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

        In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, 1/4 cup of the steak
        sauce, fajita seasoning, and dried onion until well blended. Form the
        mixture into 8 patties. Set aside 4 of the patties. On the other 4
        patties, place one slice of cheese, some of the green chilies, and some
        mushrooms. Place the other 4 patties over the top, press down, and seal
        the edges so the goodies do not escape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="nums-in-steps">2</span>Preheat an outdoor grill for low
        heat. Lightly oil grate.
      </li>

        <span class="nums-in-steps">3</span>
        Place patties on the grill, and let them brown on both sides. Once they
        begin to brown, brush the tops with remaining steak sauce. Continue to
        grill for about 30 minutes, basting frequently with steak sauce, until
        meat is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. When the meat is ready
        to come off the grill, place the remaining 4 slices of cheese over the
        tops of the patties. Serve on buns, or just by themselves.
