      The crispy batter, crunchy cookie, and creamy filling combine to make one
      of the world's most decadent fair foods. "This is a carnival favorite
      where I grew up," says Olivia C. "Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and
      friedâ€”yummy! You can do this with or without a deep fryer."
